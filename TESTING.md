To begin testing, please follow the guidelines in the README.txt

These are the VMs in this array just so you know the numbers:

After running the tracker and peer scrips,
With one tracker and 3 peers the tracker gives the following output once connected to the peers:

We see that the peers also receive the genesis block:

We added two extra peers to show that the tracker elegantly handled joining:

Now we had a peer leave and you can see the gracious exiting:

The same peer reentered graciously:

- You can see that the same peer has a new port since we changed it to avoid conflicts

Application demonstration using our GUI:
After properly launching the GUI by entered the tracker IP you see this:

We have an external IP field that you use to modify which peer you want to add the review on behalf of,

Adding our first review:

This is the JSON view of the blockchain in the GUI after the node was added (click update first):

You can see the updates for each additional peer as well:

Now a second add from a different node, this shows successful broadcasting:

We updated the block size to 2 reviews per block (we will show how during demo):

The one line of code that was changed is the last one in this ss of peer.py:
